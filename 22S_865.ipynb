    "_“If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.” – Albert Einstein_\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining technical concepts to a non-technical audience is an underappreciated skill; one which the GMMA/MMA program aims to give its students; and one that will truly set you apart in the job market. The only way to gain a skill is by practice, so here we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer each question below as though you were talking to a 5 year old (equivalently: a grandma, or a completely non-technical manager, or an Ivey grad). Use your own words. Use analogies where possible. Examples are better than theory. Keep it short, but be complete. Use simple, plain English. Do not use business buzzwords like _actualize, empower, fungible, leverage, or synergize_. Do not use technical buzzwords that most people don’t know like _model, agile, bandwidth, IoT, blockchain, AR, VR, actionable insights_. Inform the audience without going into too much technical detail. Your goal is to truly help them understand, not to give what you feel is a “technically precise” answer and move on (but they still don’t understand!). Don’t be that guy!\n",
    "\n",
    "Please keep each answer to 1000 characters or less.\n",
